# leaflet-challenge
This is the challenge of module 15, to carry out this challenge I have used the material given in the Bootcamp classes, ChatGPT, the class tutorials and the suggestions given in Slack.

## Instructions

The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts:

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
Your first task is to visualize an earthquake dataset. Complete the following steps:

1) Get your dataset. To do so, follow these steps:
   - The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed, page and choose a dataset to visualize.
   - When you click a dataset (such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days"), you will be given a JSON representation of that data. Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.

2) Import and visualize the data.    

Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning)
Plot a second dataset on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. You will need to pull in this dataset and visualize it alongside your original data. This part is completely optional; you can complete this part as a way to challenge yourself and boost your new skills.
